NeuroScan AI is a sophisticated, interactive web application designed for the preliminary analysis of brain MRI scans. It leverages a powerful deep learning model to classify brain tumors into four categories and provides advanced explainability features to visualize the model's decision-making process.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multi-Class Tumor Classification:** Classifies brain MRIs into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor.
- **AI-Powered Tumor Localization:** Uses heatmaps to draw accurate semi-transparent contours over predicted tumor regions.
- **Explainable AI (XAI) with Grad-CAM:** Provides visual insights into the model’s predictions.
- **Automated Report Generation:** Generates downloadable `.docx` reports with patient details and analysis results.
- **Patient History Management:** Saves session results and allows downloading as `.csv`.
- **Modern & Responsive UI:** Dark-themed, intuitive interface built with Streamlit.
- **Feature-Rich Sidebar:** Displays dynamic session statistics, data management, and resource links.

## 🧠 Model Architecture & Training

- **Base Model:** EfficientNetV2-B2 pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **Custom Head:**
  - GlobalAveragePooling2D  
  - Dense(512, activation='relu')  
  - BatchNormalization  
  - Dropout(0.7)  
  - Dense(4, activation='softmax')  

- **Training Strategy:**
  1. Feature extraction: Train custom head, freeze base model.  
  2. Fine-tuning: Unfreeze entire model, train with low learning rate.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend & Modeling:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, SciPy  
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV, Pillow (PIL)  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas  
- **Report Generation:** python-docx
